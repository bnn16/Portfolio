          The backbone of this portfolio is built on React, a powerful
          JavaScript library for building user interfaces. This choice ensures a
          seamless and dynamic user experience, allowing for efficient updates
          and modifications. Crafting a visually appealing and responsive design
          is crucial, and Tailwind CSS has been instrumental in achieving this.
          It's a utility-first CSS framework that enables me to create a modern
          and clean aesthetic with ease.

          To infuse some life into the background and in the website, I've
          incorporated TSparticle and Framer Motion. Those libraries allow for
          the creation of dynamic and customizable particle animations, adding a
          unique visual element to the overall design.
