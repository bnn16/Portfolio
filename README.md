## Introduction

This portfolio is built with ReactJS for the front-end, utilizing TailwindCSS for styling and ESLint with Airbnb style for code linting. It serves as a showcase for my projects, skills, and achievements.

## Technologies

- **ReactJS:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TailwindCSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
- **ESLint:** A pluggable linting utility for JavaScript and JSX, configured with Airbnb style guide.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bnn16/portfolio
cd portfolio
```
Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
npm start
```
Open your browser and visit http://localhost:3000.

## Project Structure

The project structure follows a standard ReactJS application layout:
```bash
src/
|-- components/
|-- constants/
|-- img/
|-- pages/
|-- sections/
|-- snippets/
|-- App.jsx
|-- index.js
```

- **components:** Contains reusable React components.
- **constants:** Contains the non changing files like particles and Project Data.
- **img:** Houses the images for the pages.
- **pages:** Houses individual pages of projects of the portfolio.
- **sections:** Houses the sections of the page.
- **snippets:** Houses code and json snippets from projects.

## Linting

This project uses ESLint with the Airbnb style guide to maintain code quality and consistency.
